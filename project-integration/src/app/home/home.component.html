      <p class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light  border text-justify col-6">A stock exchange, securities exchange or bourse
       is a facility where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell securities, 
       such as shares of stock and bonds and other financial instruments.
        Stock exchanges may also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of 
        such securities and instruments and capital events including the payment
         of income and dividends.[citation needed] Securities traded on a 
        stock exchange include stock issued by listed companies, unit trusts,
         derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. 
         Stock exchanges often function as "continuous auction" 
         markets with buyers and sellers consummating transactions via
          open outcry at a central location such as the floor of the exchange or
           by using an electronic trading platform.To be able to trade a security on
            a certain stock exchange, the security must be listed there. Usually, there is a central 
            location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to a physical 
            place, as modern markets use electronic communication networks, which give them advantages 
            of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is restricted to
             brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, 
             such as electronic communication networks, alternative trading systems and "dark pools" 
        have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.
